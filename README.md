### Description
This is a simple project that uses the [skyware](https://skyware.js.org/guides/jetstream/introduction/getting-started/) 
client to connect to a [Jetstream](https://jetstream.js.org/) server.

It also shows how to use the [@atproto/api](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/get-started) package to interact with the
Bluesky service.
